Developed for RR Donnelley

July 2024

## Summary
This application is designed to compare multiple files to identify and highlight differences effectively. Clients will be able to drag and drop or select as many documents as they want to be compared. Key features include the ability to compare entire documents, individual paragraphs, or sentences, with a focus on highlighting changes and similarities. Users can set a percentage threshold of content similarity to determine the likeness across files and utilize keyword detection for more precise comparisons. The application offers various comparison levels and options providing flexibility for different user needs. Users can select specific options for detailed analysis and highlighting differences.

The core comparison functionality is built using Python. The backend is built using Django, ensuring robust server-side functionality, while the frontend is developed with React, offering a responsive and interactive user interface.

In the future, the project aims to integrate with PowerStream, enhancing its functionality and providing more seamless document management and comparison capabilities. This integration will allow clients to have a seamless platform for file saving and comparisons.
